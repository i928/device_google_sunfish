# Install the KernelSU module zips that ship with the ROM, once each.
#
# The point is a wiped device: `fastboot -w` erases /data and /sdcard, so every
# module and every zip staged there is gone. Zips under /product survive, because
# they are part of the image, so a freshly wiped phone can set itself back up with
# no transfers at all.
#
# Each zip is installed at most once; the marker files live in /data/adb, so a
# later wipe deliberately makes them install again. Adding a new zip to the ROM
# installs only that one, since markers are per-file.
#
# Install order is filename order, which is why the zips carry numeric prefixes:
# the Zygisk implementation (10-ReZygisk) has to be installed before the Zygisk
# modules that load through it (20-*). Renaming a zip makes it install again,
# since the marker is keyed on the filename.
#
# Expected log on a wiped device (/data/adb/ksu-autoinstall.log):

#           [REBOOT CMD]
#   boot 2: [SCRIPT TRIGGERED] -> [MODULES ACTIVE] 8 -> [NOTHING TO DO]
